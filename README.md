# RestaurantList_API_Backend

The run this project...

- clone the frontend and backend repos:

    https://github.com/Ice-and-Rock/RestaurantList_API_Backend

    https://github.com/Ice-and-Rock/RestaurantList_API_Frontend

- run <code>npm i</code> when you're in the root folder of both folders in terminal
- run <code>npm run start</code> in the BACKEND root folder first
    - this should start the server on PORT3000
- run <code>npm run start</code> in the FRONTEND root folder
     
     a message will appear in Terminal:
<code>Would you like to run the app on another port instead? â€º (Y/n)</code>
    - press <code>y</code> then enter
- this will start the frontend in PORT3001

Note that the <code>start</code> command runs <code>nodemon</code> for the backend server and <code>react-scripts</code> for the frontend server. Any code changes you make in these folders will trigger the application to re-render automatically.
